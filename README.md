# SharpPhysFS
## PhysicsFS wrapper for .NET

This library is a wrapper around the [PhysFS library](https://icculus.org/physfs/) designed
to work with .NET languages. As such, it employs standard .NET behaviors such as *Exceptions*
and *IEnumerable*s to represent native objects. It also provides access to the underlying low-level
methods and a *Stream* subclass for easy use of the APIs.

The documentation for the methods is copied from the original doxygen and only slightly adapted.
